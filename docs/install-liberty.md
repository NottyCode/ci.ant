## install-liberty task
---

The `install-liberty` task is used to download and install Liberty profile server. The task can download the Liberty runtime archive from a specified location (via `runtimeUrl`) or automatically resolve it from the [Liberty repository](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/) based on a version and a runtime type. 

In certain cases, the Liberty license code may need to be provided in order to install the runtime. If the license code is required and if you are installing Liberty from the Liberty repository, you can obtain the license code by reading the [current license](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/wasdev/downloads/wlp/16.0.0.2/lafiles/runtime/en.html) and looking for the `D/N: <license code>` line. Otherwise, download the runtime archive and execute `java -jar wlp*runtime.jar --viewLicenseInfo` command and look for the `D/N: <license code>` line.

| runtimeUrl | URL to the Liberty profile's `.jar` or a `.zip` file. If not set, the Liberty repository will be used to find the Liberty runtime archive. | No |
| baseDir | The base installation directory. The actual installation directory of Liberty profile will be `${baseDir}/wlp`. The default value is `.` (current working directory). | No | 
| cacheDir | The directory used for caching downloaded files such as the license or `.jar` files. The default value is `${java.io.tmpdir}/wlp-cache`. | No |
